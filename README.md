# cjmaze

A Clojure library designed to generate simple mazes

## Usage

Use brandonson.cjmaze.core to generate a list of walls which make up a maze.
If you need the maze in an array-like cell-based format, use functions in brandonson.cjmaze.grid to
convert a generated maze to a 2-dimensional vector of cells.
